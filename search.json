    "text": "For our capstone project we will be analyzing a Kaggle data set on car accidents in the United States. The data set contains accident reports from February 2016 through December 2021 using various APIs. There are 2.8 million accidents reported in this data set. There are 47 different features making this data set quite large. We will be using a 10% subset of the data for ease of computing.\n\n\nWhat features are strongly associated with the severity of a car accident?\nWhich model best predicts the severity of a car accident?\n\n\n\n Linear Regression: also known as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is the most simple method for regression analysis.\nThe linear regression model for predicting the severity of a car accident is:\n\\[\\hat{y}=\\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_i} \\times x + \\epsilon\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{y}\\) is the predicted severity of a car accident, \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) is the intercept term, \\(\\hat{\\beta_i}\\) is the beta estimate for each feature, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term.\nThe model minimizes the mean squared error, which is written as:\n\\[MSE({\\beta})=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n  \\hat{\\epsilon_i}^2=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n  (y_i-\\hat{y_i})^2\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{y_i}\\) is the predicted severity of a car accident and \\(y_i\\) is the actual severity.\n Ridge Regression:  A regularized version of linear regression. This is achieved by adding this equation to the loss function:\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^n  \\beta_i^2\\]\nThe cost function for ridge regression is as follows:\n\\[\n(\\beta) = MSE(\\beta) + \\frac{1}{n} \\alpha \\sum_{i=1}^n  \\beta_i^2\n\\]\nwhere \\(MSE(\\beta)\\) is the mean squared error function, \\(\\beta_i\\) is the coefficient of the \\(i\\)-th feature, \\(n\\) is the number of samples, and \\(\\alpha\\) is the regularization strength.\n Lasso Regression:  Like Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression adds a regularization term to the cost function, but uses the l1 norm of the weight vector instead of half the square of the l2 norm. The cost function for Lasso Regression is as follows:\n\\[J(\\beta) = MSE(\\beta) +  \\alpha \\sum_{i=1}^n  |\\beta_i|\\]\nwhere \\(MSE(\\beta)\\) is the mean squared error function, \\(\\beta_i\\) is the coefficient of the \\(i\\)-th feature, \\(n\\) is the number of samples, and \\(\\alpha\\) is the regularization strength.\n Random Forest:  They are comprised of many slightly different decision trees. The decision trees that make up the random forest are generated randomly giving it the name Random Forest. Depending on the number of trees in the forest, this could be a highly accurate model, but could also have the tendency to over fit the data. Random Forests are one way to combat the over fitting problem that Decision Tree Models may have."

    "text": "2.1 About the Data\nThe target variable that we will be using is called “Severity” which indicates the severity of the accident scored on a numeric scale from 1-4. A score of 1 would indicate that the accident was not severe and had a little impact on traffic whereas a 4 would mean the accident had a large impact on traffic and was highly severe. We do not plan on utilizing all of the features provided in the data set. Instead we will only be using 11 in our models. The features include “State”, “Temperature(F)”, “Humidity(%)”, “Visibility(mi)”, “Wind_Speed(mph)”, “Weather_Condition”, “Precipitation(in)”, “Crossing”, “Junction”, “Traffic_Signal”, and “Sunrise_Sunset”. Using these variables in conjunction with supervised machine learning techniques, we will be able to predict the severity of a certain accident."

This indicates that these variables were statistically significant. These include: \nHumidity  Crossing  Traffic Signal  Several States  Light Drizzle/Windy  Light Freezing rain/windy  Ice Pellets  Overcast Conditions  Smoky, Windy Conditions  Sunrise/Sunset/Night\n\n6.1.1 Interpretations of Statistically significant variables:\nHumidity had a beta estimate of 0.007, which means that as humidity percentage increases by one percentage point, severity increases by 0.007. \nIf there is a crosswalk nearby, the severity of an accident decreases by 0.036 percent \nIf there is a traffic signal nearby, the severity of the accident decreases by 0.014 \nThe highest beta estimate magnitude had to do with the state in which an accident occurred. The state with the highest impact on accident severity is Wisconsin. The severity of an accident increases by 1.43 if the accident occurred in Wisconsin. Arizona has a beta estimate of -0.199, the lowest of the states surveyed. This means that if an accident were to occur in Arizona, the severity decreases by 0.199. \nIf there is a light drizzle of rain, mixed with windy conditions, the severity of accidents is expected to increase by 0.659 \nIf there is light freezing rain mixed with windy conditions, the severity of an accident is expected to increase by 0.871."

    "text": "6.3 Potential Policy Recommendations\nThere are a couple of potential reasons why Wisconsin suffers the most severe car accidents. One of these reasons is that Wisconsin is subject to extreme weather (lots of rain and snow) that can cause dangerous road conditions, thus contributing to fatal car accidents. When looking at a study by Mingo & Yankala, it is shown that five of the nine deadliest road segments in the state of Wisconsin are located in Milwaukee, which is Wisconsin’s most densely populated area. The way that these roads are constructed potentially contributes to the number of severe car accidents that occur. Each of these segments intersects with another main road or highway or has an interchange with an interstate. One potential way to combat the prominence of severe car accidents on these segments is to decrease the speed limit on these stretches of roads, especially where they intersect/interchange with other main roads. Wisconsin is also the 10th worst state when it comes to arrests/fatalities for driving under the influence. Wisconsin should look to hand out more severe punishment for DUI charges in order to attempt to prevent this risky behavior. https://www.mysclaw.com/the-deadliest-road-stretches-in-wisconsin/#:~:text=Heavily%20trafficked%20roads%20such%20as,higher%20incident%20rate%20of%20accidents\n\nAlthough New Hampshire does not have areas as densely populated as a metropolitan area such as Milwaukee, there are glaring reasons why accidents tend to be more severe. According to Tenn and Tenn, Attorneys at law, New Hampshire struggles to maintain the conditions of their roads. While other state governments may handle poor road conditions quickly and properly, unfortunately, New Hampshire does not. Many of the roads in New Hampshire are cracked/broken, and feature overgrown plant life. There are poor road designs in New Hampshire and many potholes. One large issue with many New Hampshire roads is that they feature curves that are not marked by road signs. One policy suggestion that we have for New Hampshire to combat its severe car accident problem is to mark winding, curved roads with road signs. New Hampshire’s state and local governments must also make more of an effort to fix roads that are damaged by weather, and car accidents at a much faster pace, rather than leaving these hazardous conditions to cause even more accidents. https://www.tennandtenn.com/car-accidents/dangerous-road-conditions/\n\nWhile investigating why many of the states with the highest likelihood for an accident to be severe, the overwhelming majority of these states cite speeding, distracted driving (cell phones), weather, drowsiness, and drunk driving as the main reasons for the severity of their accidents. While there is no reasonable way to completely eliminate these severe accidents through policy, state and local governments can make more of an effort to promote the laws that are already in place. For example, state and local governments can issue higher, more severe penalties for driving under the influence, and being caught on your phone while driving. Also, state and local governments can again make more of an effort to keep their roads in the best condition possible by removing debris, filling potholes, and making sure that adequate street signs are in place to point out potentially hazardous road conditions."
